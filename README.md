# TypeSpec
An experimental TypeScript BDD framework.

The aim is to properly separate the business specifications from the code, but rather than code-generate (like Java or C# BDD tools), the tests will be loaded in and executed on the fly without converting the text into an intermediate language. This should allow tests to be written in any unit testing framework - or even without one.
