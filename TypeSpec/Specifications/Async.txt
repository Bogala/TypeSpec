Feature: Asynchronous Steps
       In order to include aync activities in my tests
       As a BDD enthusiast
       I want to be able to tell TypeSpec to wait

Scenario: Asynchronous Steps
    Given I am using a calculator
    And I enter "50" into the calculator
    And I asynchronously enter "70" into the calculator
    When I press the total button
    Then the result should be "120" on the screen
