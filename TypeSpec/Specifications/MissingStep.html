Feature: Missing Step Example
       In order to know a step is missing
       As a BDD enthusiast
       I want to be told when a condition doesn't have a corresponding step definition

Scenario: Missing Step Example
       Given I am using a calculator
       And I have entered "15" into the calculator
       And I have entered "18" into the calculator
       When I press a button that isn't yet defined
       Then the result should be "33" on the screen
